# Team Kick-off Agenda

## Intro
A team kick-off helps a new team through the forming phase, and an existing team through the norming phase. The purpose is to build or strengthen the foundations on which the team will grow and set them in good stead. It's important that significant time is allocated to recognize its value, and organizing it as an offsite helps to solidify this.

## Working agreement | 1hr
A working agreement is a social contract that outlines norms for how members should interact with one another to be successful. Topics could include how decisions will be made, how to communicate, share information or support one another. It is a living document that can be expanded or edited, should be somewhere visible and be regularly referred to in order to hold one another accountable. Ultimately it helps to develop a team culture.
