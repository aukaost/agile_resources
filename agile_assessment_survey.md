# Agile Assessment Tool
To perform regularly to gauge improvements and identify areas of focus.
Scale 1-5. (Strongly Disagree - Strongly Agree)
Questions should be answered within the context of the entire tech and product departments.

What makes this different to other seurveys such as Peakon?
This survey is specifically from an agility perspective. It helps identify potential improvement areas in how we operate that we can then further explore and hopefully address. Essentially this survey could affect our strategy for agility.


## Engagement [P5-build projects around motivated individuals]
1. I feel that our environment provides basic support and processes necessary to do my job without much frustration (working conditions, equipment, development processes, access requests, on-boarding, tooling, career progression, adequate performance reviews and 1-1s etc.)
2. I feel secure in my role (safety to disagree, to raise issues, my contract and notice period are fair, company is stable etc.)
3. I feel that our environment is respectful. (Do you feel it recognises, empowers, supports, provides clear expectations to, considers and trusts its employees?)
4. I feel the work I do makes a difference to our customers
5. I have the opportunity to grow professionally
6. I have reasonable control and flexibility over my work

## Transparency & Collaboration
1. I feel that, within our department, individuals and teams collaborate closely together (as opposed to being silos) INTERNAL COLLABORATION
2. I feel that decisions made within the product and tech departments are inclusive and well communicated (strategy, internal changes etc.) DECISION MAKING
3. I feel all teams are strategically aligned STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT
4. I feel that tech teams closely collaborate with stakeholders and customers [P4-developers working closely with business people e.g. feedback] CUSTOMER COLLABORATION
5. I feel that I have a say in the direction of the tech and product departments PARTNERING
6. I feel that we are clearly and visibly tracking the progress and/ or health of the teams, department, and product CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

## Valuable continuous delivery (satisfy customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software) P1
1. I feel we are building the right things (Customer feedback? Data driven?) VALUE
2. I feel we effectively employ best practices in our everyday work (technical excellence, product excellence) QUALITY (PROCESS)
3. I feel that the quality of our product is high (agile testing?) QUALITY (OUTPUT)
4. I feel that we are able to respond quickly enough to changing requirements [P2-changing requirements] REACTION TIME
5. I feel we are innovative INNOVATION
6. I feel we are delivering (to the customer) at a sustainable pace [P8-sustainable development pace] SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

## Rapid experimenting and learning (continuous improvement)
1. I feel our time-to-market is acceptable [P3-frequent delivery]
2. I feel our environment is empirical (Do we regularly stop to learn from and make decisions based on validated observations and data rather than pure theory or assumptions?) [P12-regularly reflect] CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
3. I feel our technical setup is mature enough to support rapid experimenting I.e. we deploy but also recover quickly from failures (maintainable code-base, automated devops, automated test suites, technical debt, de-coupled architecture, ‘fail-safe’ techniques such as canary releases, release trains etc.) [P9-technical excellence]
4. I feel our environment attitude is ‘fail-friendly’?
5. I feel our teams have few dependencies? [P11-self-organizing teams]
6. I feel that we generally keep solutions simple? [P10-simplicity]
